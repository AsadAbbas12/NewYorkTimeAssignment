# How to run the code
1 - clone the link it will be given on the repository   <br />
2 - Or download the project and import project in android studio


# Mockito Framework
Enough about the great features of the app. 
Letâ€™s dive into the test cases written for NewsList activity.
In news list activity we are using liveData , ViewModel Combinations.
In ViewModel class we are going to test the repository class methods like network call to the server

Just goto the Repository class find method of loadNewsData <br />
1 - Right click on the method find the goto from the drop down menu and click test

3 - So the following method will be generated and @Before and @Test so we will write over test on @Test Method.
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) will be used to load all the notation classes which the mockito frame work has and 
@Mock i declared to test the speciy class of the project
